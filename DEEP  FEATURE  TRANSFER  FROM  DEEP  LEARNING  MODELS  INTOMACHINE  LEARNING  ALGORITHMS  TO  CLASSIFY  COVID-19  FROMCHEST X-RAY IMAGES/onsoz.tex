I would like to express my deepest sincere gratitude to my thesis advisor Assist. Prof. Dr. Gül İNAN for supporting and encouraging me with her immense knowledge during the writing process of my thesis. From the day I enrolled in the master's program, regardless of time and place, she was with me at every step of the way and became more than an lecturer for me.

I would like to sincerely thank Assoc. Prof. Dr. Süreyya AKYÜZ and Assoc. Prof. Dr. Behçet Uğur TÖREYİN for their time and valuable contribution.

Last but not least, I would like to express my endless thanks to my beloved mother, father, Kübra ÖZCAN, and my managers Mehmet Oğuz BİCİ and Kemal UĞUR, who have never lost their support from me. They have never lost their faith in me and have always been full of love and understanding.
